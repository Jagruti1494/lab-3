# PHP System Setup with XAMPP

This README provides instructions for setting up and running a PHP system using XAMPP. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

1. **XAMPP**: Ensure that you have [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) installed on your system. If you don't have it, download and install it from the link provided.

2. **PHP Files**: You should have your PHP files in a folder, ready to be placed in the `htdocs` directory of XAMPP.

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Install XAMPP (If Not Installed)
- Download the installer for your operating system from the [official website](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
- Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### Step 2: Place Your PHP Files in the `htdocs` Folder
- After installing XAMPP, navigate to the XAMPP installation folder.
  - On Windows, it's typically located in `C:\xampp`.
- Inside the `xampp` folder, find the `htdocs` folder. This is where you'll place your PHP files.
- Create a new folder inside `htdocs` (e.g., `my-php-app`) and copy your PHP files into this folder.

### Step 3: Start Apache Server
- Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
- Start the **Apache** server by clicking the `Start` button next to **Apache**.
- Ensure the **MySQL** server is running if your PHP application connects to a database.

### Step 4: Access Your PHP Application in the Browser
- Open your web browser and navigate to:
